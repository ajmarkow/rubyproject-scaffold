What do we want the script to do?
If you’re interested in scripting, here’s a fun challenge. Make sure you complete Coin Combinations before taking on this project.

Many frameworks such as Rails allow you to create the entire structure for a project with a single line of code in the terminal. Your goal is to create a script that will do the same for a basic Ruby project.


Create the root directory and the lib and spec directories. (Check out Ruby’s FileUtils library.)

Create a Gemfile and put it in the root directory. (Check out the File.open() method if you haven’t already.)

Then your script should provide a prompt to users that allows them to enter the name of any classes they plan to include in their application.
     For instance, a project called shapes might have the following classes: Triangle, Square, Circle. Your script should then create .rb files and spec.rb files for each of the classes in the appropriate directories.

Finally, your script should add a little basic code to these created files. For instance, triangle.rb might include:
class Triangle
End 

require 'triangle'

describe('Triangle') do
end


Project name with a prompt:  gets.chomp the project name
Create a directory with that project name
Create the lib and spec subdirectories
Create the gemfile in root
Prompt: Ask user for names of classes, separated by commas 
Create class.rb files and class_spec.rib files in lib and spec directories respectively.
Print success message.
